Fake sender address: “service@realme.com” (trying to look like realme service center)

receviced address is :"wemebir379@hostbyt.com"(a temp mail)

the body of the email was to update the phone from attacking from virus and to click an url
"https://realme-support-safety.com/"

even though when virustotal website said its an safe url u cant open that url 

websites used:

1."https://emkei.cz/" : to send a fake email

2."https://temp-mail.org/en/view/6893841f05a88d0038a9cfe4" : to create an fake email address
